# What features are supported ?

We support 2 backends: Cephadm and Rook. The features each support differ, and this compatibility matrix aims to document what is achievable for both.

A green light means that a particular feature is supported, and a red light means that it isn't. A yellow light means that a feature is _technically_ supported, but needs a considerable amount of fiddling.
