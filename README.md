# Ubuntu Ceph Container Images
Home to Ubuntu based Ceph container Images.

## What features are supported ?

We support 2 backends: Cephadm and Rook. The features each support differ, and this compatibility matrix aims to document what is achievable for both.

> **_NOTE:_**
A green light means that a particular feature is supported, and a red light means that it isn't. A yellow light means that a feature is _technically_ supported, but needs a considerable amount of fiddling.

## How to download pre-built images ?
Visit our [Packages](https://github.com/canonical/ceph-containers/pkgs/container/ceph) page.

## How to build

We provide a Dockerfile that can be used to build the image and the supporting scripts that go with it. Hence we can simply use Docker to build an image:
```
$ sudo docker build -t canonical/ceph:latest .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  1.655MB
Step 1/27 : FROM ubuntu:jammy
 ---> 6b7dfa7e8fdb
...
...
 ---> Running in f431f665b976
Removing intermediate container f431f665b976
 ---> 4edce85e2d97
Successfully built 4edce85e2d97
Successfully tagged canonical/ceph:latest
```

> **_NOTE:_**
Due to a provisional fix additional build arguments are temporarily required to be provided for building the container image.
```
$ sudo docker build -t canonical/ceph:latest --build-arg CUSTOM_APT_REPO=ppa:peter-sabaini/ceph-test .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  1.655MB
...
Successfully tagged canonical/ceph:latest
```

All images available locally can be checked through:
```
$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY     TAG    IMAGE ID     CREATED            SIZE
canonical/ceph latest 4edce85e2d97 About a minute ago 1.49GB
ubuntu         jammy  6b7dfa7e8fdb 4 weeks ago        77.8MB
```

This freshly baked Image can now be used for deploying Ceph using:
1. [Cephadm](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/using-cephadm-to-deploy-custom-ubuntu-ceph-images-in-a-containerised-manner/)
2. [Rook](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/deploying-ceph-with-rook/)

## Automated local deployments using cephadm and lxd

We also provide a python3 script which can deploy a single node ceph cluster for you to tinker with using our image, cephadm and lxd. For this to work the host should have lxd snap installed and initialised.

```
$ sudo snap install lxd
$ lxd init --auto
```

### Script Usage:
1.) Use Script to setup a lxd Host and deploy Cephadm using a freshly built image:
```
python3 test/deploy.py build
```
2.) Use Script to clean a deployment (using script generated model file):
```
python3 test/deploy.py delete model-88HJ.json
```
3.) Use Script to deploy a custom image:
```
python3 test/deploy.py image <qualified_image_name>
```
> **_NOTE:_**
<qualified_image_name> can be a reference to a container image hosted on any public container registry.
For Example:
```
$ python3 test/deploy.py image ghcr.io/canonical/ceph:main
```

> **_NOTE:_**
You can also use the script to deploy (experimentally) on a LXD container (rather than a VM) using '--container 1', this can be intersting when no KVM support is available on the machine. However, this is not recommended.
For detailed info on script usage use:
```
python3 test/deploy.py --help
```

VM prepared by Script: 
```
